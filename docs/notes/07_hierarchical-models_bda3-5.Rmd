## Notes

### Reading instructions

- "The hierarchical models in the chapter are simple to keep computation simple. More advanced computational tools are presented in Chapters 10-12 (part of the course) and 13 (not part of the course)."

#### Exchangeability vs. independence

- exchangeability and independence are two separate concepts; neither necessarily implies the other
  - independent identically distributed variables/parameters are exchangeable
  - exchangeability is less strict condition than independence

#### Weakly informative priors for hierarchical variance parameters

- suggestions have changed since writing section 5.7
  - section 5.7 recommends use of half-Cauchy as weakly informative prior for hierarchical variance parameters
  - now recommend a "half-normal if you have substantial information on the high end values, or or half-$t_4$ if you there might be possibility of surprise"
  - "half-normal produces usually more sensible prior predictive distributions and is thus better justified"
  - "half-normal leads also usually to easier inference"

### Chapter 5. Hierarchical models

- individual parameters for groups can be modeled as coming from a *population distribution*
  - model these relationships hierarchically
- hierarchical models can often have more parameters than data but avoid overfitting of traditional linear models
- sections
  - 5.2: how to construct a hierarchical prior distribution in the context of a fully Bayesian analysis
  - 5.7: weakly informative priors

#### 1. Constructing a parameterized prior distribution

- have historical data to inform our model
  - can use it to construct a prior for our new data or use it as data to inform the posterior
  - probably should not use it for both though, thus favor using it directly in the model alongside our new data
- for each experiment $j$, with data $y_j$, estimate the parameter $\theta_j$
  - the parameters $\theta_j$ can come from a *population distribution* parameterized by $\text{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$

#### 5.2 Exchangeability and hierarchical models

- if no information (other than $y$) is available to distinguish any of the $\theta_j$'s, and no ordering (time) or grouping can be made, then we must assume symmetry among the parameters in the prior distribution
  - *this symmetry is represented probabilistically by exchangeability*: the parameters $(\theta_1, \dots, \theta_J)$ are *exchangeable* in the join distribution if $p(\theta_1, \dots, \theta_J)$ is invariant to permutations of the indices $(1, \dots, J)$
- "in practice, ignorance implies exchangeability" (pg. 104)
  - the less we know about a problem, the more confident we can claim exchangeability (i.e. we don't know any better)
- exchangeability is not the same as i.i.d:
  - probability of a die landing on each face: parameters $(\theta_1, \dots, \theta_6)$ are exchangeable because we think the faces are all the same, but they are not independent because the total must sum to 1
- exchangeability when additional information is available on the groups
  - if the observations can be grouped in their own submodels, but the group properties are unknown, can make a common prior distribution for the group properties
  - if $y_i$ has additional information $x_i$ so that $y_i$ are not exchangeable, but $(y_i, x_i)$ are exchangeable, we can make a join model for $(y_i, x_i)$ or a conditional model $y_i | x_i$
- the usual way to model exchangeability with covariates is through conditional independence

$$
p(\theta_1, \dots, \theta_J | x_1, \dots, x_J) = \int [\prod_{j=1}^J p(\theta_j | \phi, x_j)] p(\phi|x) d \phi
$$

- $phi$ is unknown, so it gets a prior distribution, too $p(\phi)$
  - the posterior distribution is of the vector $(\phi, \theta)$
  - thus the joint prior is: $p(\phi, \theta) = p(\phi) p(\theta|\phi)$
- joint posterior:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(\phi, \theta | y) &\propto p(\phi, \theta) p(y|\phi, \theta) \\
 &= p(\phi, \theta) p(y|\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

- posterior predictive distributions
  - get predictions on both levels

#### 5.3 Bayesian analysis of conjugate hierarchical models

- analysis derivation of conditional and marginal distributions
  1. write the (unnormalized) joint posterior density $p(\theta, \phi | y)$ as a product of the hyperprior $p(\phi)$, the population distribution $p(\theta|\phi)$ and the likelihood $p(y|\theta)$
  2. determine the conditional posterior density of $\theta$ given $\phi$: $p(\theta | \phi, y)$
  3. estimate $\phi$ from its marginal posterior distribution $p(\phi|y)$
- drawing simulations from the posterior distribution
  1. draw $\phi$ from $p(\phi|y)$
  2. draw $\theta$ from its conditional posterior distribution $p(\theta | \phi, y)$ using the values of $\phi$ from the previous step
  3. draw predictive values $\tilde{y}$ given the values of $\theta$
- example on rat tumors is a good demonstration of the shrinkage of parameter estimates in a hierarchical model
  - the 1:1 line represents where the posteriors would be for a non-pooling model
  - can see the shrinkage of the extreme values towards the average
  - the effect is stronger for experiments with fewer rats

#### 5.4 Normal model with exchangeable parameters

- drawing posterior predictive samples:
  1. for new data $\tilde{y}$ of existing groups $J$, use the posterior distributions for $(\theta_1, \dots, \theta_j)$
  2. for new data $\tilde{y}$ for $\tilde{J}$ new groups:
    1. draw values for the hyperparameters $\mu, \tau$ (in this case)
    2. draw $\tilde{J}$ new parameters $(\tilde{\theta}_1, \dots, \tilde{\theta}_\tilde{J})$ from $p(\tilde{\theta} | \mu, \tau)$
    3. draw $\tilde{y}$ given $\tilde{\theta}$

#### 5.5 Example: parallel experiments in eight schools

- a full example of a Bayesian hierarchical modeling process and analysis

#### 5.6 Hierarchical modeling applied to a meta-analysis

- another good example of analyzing the results of a Bayesian hierarchical model
  - notes the importance of interpreting both the mean and standard error hyperparameters to interpret the distribution of possible parameter values

#### 5.7 Weakly informative priors for variance parameters

- "It turns out the the choice of 'noninformative' prior distribution can have a big effect on inferences," (pg. 128)
  - uniform prior distributions will often lead to overly-dispersed posteriors
    - this is especially true for the standard error term of a hyperparameter when there are few groups
  - half-Cauchy is often a good balance between restricting the prior to reasonable value but with fat enough tails to allow for uncertainty
    - particularly good for variance parameters of hierarchical models with few groups

- description of the diagram of a hierarchical model
  - box: known value
    - double box: indicates a fixed experimental value (e.g. decided how many rats to include in an experiment)
  - circle: unknown parameter
  - box with the subscript $j$: indicates that everything within the box is repeated $J$ times

- hierarchical model shrinkage effects with sample size
  - below example shows how shrinkage is stronger for data points with smaller sample size (county radon example)

  sigma = c(15, 10, 16, 11, 9, 11, 10, 18)

  mutate(school = purrr::map_chr(school, ~ LETTERS[[.x]]))

- **exchangeability**: parameters $\theta_1, \dots ,\theta_J$ (or observations $y_1, \dots , y_J$) are exchangeable if the joint distribution $p$ is invariant to the permutation of indices $(1, \dots, J)$
  - e.g.: $p(\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3) = p(\theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_1)$
- exchangeability implies symmetry
   - if there is no information which can be used a priori to separate $\theta_j$ form each other, we can assume exchangeability
   - ”Ignorance implies exchangeability”
