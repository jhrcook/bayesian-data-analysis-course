Demo codes in R demos and Python demos have a lot of useful examples for handling data and plotting figures. If you have problems, visit TA sessions or ask in course slack channel.\nIf you want to learn more, make also self study exercises listed below.\nSections\nSection\nNotes\nBook exercises\nAssignments\n1.
