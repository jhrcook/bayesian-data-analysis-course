      "contents": "\nProject work details\nProject work involves choosing a data set and performing a whole\nanalysis according to all the parts of Bayesian workflow studied along\nthe course.\nThe project work is meant to be done in period II.\nIn the beginning of the period II\nForm a group. We prefer groups of 3, but the project can be done in\ngroups of 1-2.\nSelect a topic. You may ask in the course chat channel\n#project for opinion whether it’s a good topic and a good\ndataset. You can change the topic later.\nStart planning.\n\n\nThe main work for the project and the presentation will be done in\nthe second half of the period II after all the workflow parts have been\ndiscussed in the course.\nThe online presentations will be made on the evaluation week after\nperiod II.\nAll suspected plagiarism will be reported and investigated. See more\nabout the Aalto\nUniversity Code of Academic Integrity and Handling Violations\nThereof.\nProject schedule\nForm a group and pick a topic. Register the group before end of 8th\nNov, 2021.\nGroups of 3 can reserve a presentation slot starting TBA.\nGroups of 2 can reserve a presentation slot starting TBA.\nGroups of 1 can reserve a presentation slot starting TBA.\nGroups that register late can reserve a presentation slot starting\nTBA.\nWork on the project. TA session queue is also for project\nquestions.\nProject report deadline December 6, 2021. Submit in peergrade\n(separate “class”, the link will be added to MyCourses).\nProject report peer grading December 7-9, 2021 (so that you’ll get\nfeedback for the report before the presentations).\nProject presentations December 13-17, 2021.\nGroups\nProject work is done in groups of 1-3 persons. Preferred group size\nis 3, because you learn more when you talk about the project with\nsomeone else.\nIf you don’t have a group, you can ask other students in the group\nchat channel #project. Tell what kind of data you are\ninterested in (e.g. medicine, health, biological, engineering,\npolitical, business), whether you prefer R or Python, and whether you\nhave already more concrete idea for the topic.\nGroups of 3 students can choose their presentation time slot before\n1-2 student groups. 3 person group is expected to do a bit more work\nthan 1-2 person groups.\nYou can do the project alone, but the amount of work is expected to\nthe same for 2 person groups.\nTA sessions\nThe groups will get help for the project work in TA sessions. When there are no\nweekly assignments, the TA sessions are still organized for helping in\nthe project work.\nEvaluation\nThe project work’s evaluation consists of:\npeer-graded project report (40%) (within peergrade submission 80%\nand feedack 20%)\npresentation and oral exam graded by the course staff (60%)\nclarity of slides + use of figures\nclarity of oral presentation + flow of the presentation\nall required parts included (not necessarily all in main slides, but\nit needs to be clear that all required steps were performed)\naccuracy of use of terms (oral exam)\nresponses to questions (oral exam)\n\nProject report\nIn the project report you practice presenting the problem and data\nanalysis results, which means that minimal listing of code and figures\nis not a good report. There are different levels for how data analysis\nproject could be reported. This report should be more than a summary of\nresults without workflow steps. While describing the steps and decisions\nmade during the workflow, to keep the report readable some of the\ndiagnostic outputs and code can be put in the appendix. If you are\nuncertain you can ask TAs in TA sessions whether you are on a good level\nof amount of details.\nThe report should include\nIntroduction describing\nthe motivation\nthe problem\nand the main modeling idea.\nShowing some illustrative figure is recommended.\nDescription of the data and the analysis problem. Provide\ninformation where the data was obtained, and if it has been previously\nused in some online case study and how your analysis differs from the\nexisting analyses.\nDescription of at least two models, for example:\nnon hierarchical and hierarchical,\nlinear and non linear,\nvariable selection with many models.\nInformative or weakly informative priors, and justification of their\nchoices.\nStan, rstanarm or brms code.\nHow to the Stan model was run, that is, what options were used. This\nis also more clear as combination of textual explanation and the actual\ncode line.\nConvergence diagnostics (\\(\\widehat{R}\\), ESS, divergences) and what\nwas done if the convergence was not good with the first try.\nPosterior predictive checks and what was done to improve the\nmodel.\nModel comparison (e.g. with LOO-CV).\nPredictive performance assessment if applicable (e.g. classification\naccuracy) and evaluation of practical usefulness of the accuracy.\nSensitivity analysis with respect to prior choices (i.e. checking\nwhether the result changes a lot if prior is changed)\nDiscussion of issues and potential improvements.\nConclusion what was learned from the data analysis.\nSelf-reflection of what the group learned while making the\nproject.\nProject presentation\nIn addition to the submitted report, each project must be presented\nby the authoring group, according to the following guidelines:\nThe presentation should be high level but sufficiently detailed\ninformation should be readily available to help answering questions from\nthe audience.\nThe duration of the presentation should be 10 minutes (groups of 1-2\nstudents) or 15 minutes (groups of 3 students).\nAt the end of the presentation there will be an extra 5-10 minutes\nof questions by anyone in the audience or two members of the course\nstaff who are present. The questions from lecturer/TAs can be considered\nas an oral exam questions, and if answers to these questions reveal weak\nknowledge of the methods and workflow steps which should be part of the\nproject, that can reduce the grade.\nGrading will be done by the two members of the course staff using\nstandardized grading instructions.\nSpecific recommendations for the presentations include:\nThe first slide should include project’s title and group members’\nnames.\nThe chosen statistical model(s), including observation model and\npriors, must be explained and justified,\nMake sure the font is big enough to be easily readable by the\naudience. This includes figure captions, legends and axis\ninformation,\nThe last slide should be a summary or take-home-messages and include\ncontact information or link to a further information. (The grade will be\nreduced by one if the last slide has only something like “Thank you” or\n“Questions?”),\nIn general, the best presentations are often given by teams that\nhave frequently attended TA sessions and gotten feedback, so we strongly\nrecommend attending these sessions.\nMore details on the presentation sessions\nIf you don’t have microphone or video camera (e.g. in your laptop or\nmobile phone) then we’ll arrange your presentation on campus in period\nIII.\nIf you reserved a presentation slot but need to cancel, do it\nasap.\nZoom meeting link for all time slots available in the course\nchat.\nAs we have many presentation in each slot join the meeting in time.\nLate arrivals will lower the grade. Very late arrivals will fail the\npresentation and can present in period III.\nPresenting group needs to have video and audio on.\nIt is easiest if just one from the group shares the slides, but it\nis expected that all group members present some part of the presentation\norally.\nPresentation time is 10 min for 1-2 person groups and 15min for 3\nperson groups\nTime limit is strict. It’s good idea to practice the talk so that\nyou get the timing right. Staff will announce 2min and 1min left and\ntime ended. Going overtime reduces the grade.\nAfter the presentation there will be 5min for questions, answers,\nand feedback.\nEach student has to come up with at least one question during the\nsession. Students can ask more questions. Questions by students are\nposted in chat, and they can be posted already during the\npresentation.\nStaff Will ask further questions (kind of oral exam)\nGrading of the project presentation takes int account\nclarity of slides + use of figures\nclarity of oral presentation + flow of the presentation\nall required parts included (not necessarily all in main slides, but\nit needs to be clear that all required steps were performed)\naccuracy of use of terms (oral exam)\nresponses to questions (oral exam)\n\nStudents will also self-evaluate their project. After the\npresentation each student who just presented sends a private message to\none of the staff members with a self evaluation grade from themselves\nand for each group member (if applicable).\nData sets\nAs some data sets have been overused for these particular goals, note\nthat the following ones are forbidden in this work (more can be added to\nthis list so make sure to check it regularly):\nextremly common data sets like titanic, mtcars, iris\nBaseball batting (used by Bob Carpenter’s StanCon case study).\nData sets used in the course demos\nIt’s best to use a dataset for which there is no ready made analysis\nin internet, but if you choose a dataset used already in some online\ncase study, provide the link to previous studies and report how your\nanalysis differs from those (for example if someone has made\nnon-Bayesian analysis and you do the full Bayesian analysis).\nDepending on the model and the structure of the data, a good data set\nwould have more than 100 observations but less than 1 million. If you\nknow an interesting big data set, you can use a smaller subset of the\ndata to keep the computation times feasible. It would be good that the\ndata has some structure, so that it is sensible to use\nmultilevel/hierarchical models.\nModel requirements\nEvery parameter needs to have an explicit proper prior. Improper\nflat priors are not allowed.\nA hierarchical model is a model where the prior of certain parameter\ncontain other parameters that are also estimated in the model. For\ninstance, b ~ normal(mu, sigma), mu ~ normal(0,\n1), sigma ~ exponential(1).\nDo not impose hard constrains on a parameter unless they are natural\nto them. uniform(a, b) should not be used unless the\nboundaries are really logical boundaries and values beyond the\nboundaries are completely impossible.\nAt least some models should include covariates. Modelling the\noutcome without predictors is likely too simple for the project.\nbrms can be used, but the Stan code must be included,\nbriefly commented, and all priors need to be checked from the Stan code\nand adjusted to be weakly informative based on some justified\nexplanation.\nSome examples\nThe following case study examples demonstrate how text, equations,\nfigures, and code, and inference results can be included in one report.\nThese examples don’t necessarily have all the workflow steps required in\nyour report, but different steps are illustrated in different case\nstudies and you can get good ideas for your report just by browsing\nthrough them.\nBDA R and Python demos are quite minimal in\ndescription of the data and discussion of the results, but show many\ndiagnostics and basic plots.\nSome Stan case\nstudies focus on some specific methods, but there are many case\nstudies that are excellent examples for this course. They don’t include\nall the steps required in this course, but are good examples of writing.\nSome of them are longer or use more advanced models than required in\nthis course.\nBayesian\nworkflow for disease transmission modeling in Stan\nModel-based\nInference for Causal Effects in Completely Randomized\nExperments\nTagging\nBasketball Events with HMM in Stan\nModel\nbuilding and expansion for golf putting\nA\nDyadic Item Response Theory Model\nPredator-Prey\nPopulation Dynamics: the Lotka-Volterra model in Stan\nSome StanCon\ncase studies (scroll down) can also provide good project ideas.\n",
