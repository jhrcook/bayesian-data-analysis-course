# (PART) Notes {-}

# Introduction {#notes-introduction .unnumbered}

This part of the book contains my notes from course lectures and book reading.
Sections 1-12 are based on the course's sessions whereas 13-21 are additional notes on chapters of BDA3 not included in the course.
Note that some sections are missing in this latter group because I skipped them for now, but left space in case I return.

Each section corresponding to a session of the course contains several parts.
Each begins with a list of resources for the session including readings from BDA3 or external sources (e.g. papers), lecture recordings and slides, a reading guide/instructions, and a link to any assignment instructions.
This is then followed by notes from the reading(s) and lecture.
In contrast, the sections corresponding to my additional reading just contain notes on the book's text.
