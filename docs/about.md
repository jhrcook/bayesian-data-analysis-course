## The website {-}

TODO: update this for bookdown format

This site is built with ['distill'](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and deployed on GitHub pages.
The main point of the website is to display my course notes in a easy to read and search format.
It isn't perfect nor optimal, but there is a good balance of functionality and simplicity.

## About me {-}

My name is Joshua Cook and I am (at the time of taking this course and writing this About page) a graduate student at Harvard Medical School.
My research is on cancer genetics and I have a specific love of Bayesian modelling.
You can peruse more of my projects and other work on my GitHub profile at [jhrcook](https://github.com/jhrcook) or my [website](https://joshuacook.netlify.app).
