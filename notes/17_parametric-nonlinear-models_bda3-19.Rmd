## Chapter 19. Parametric nonlinear models

- examples:
  - a ratio; $\text{E}(y = \frac{a_1 + b_1 x_1}{a_2 + b_2 x_2}$
  - sum of nonlinear functions: $\text{E}(y) = A_1 e^{-\alpha_1x} + A_2 e^{-\alpha_2x}$
- parameters of a nonlinear model are often harder to interpret
  - often requires custom visualization techniques
- **"Generally each new modeling problem must be tackled afresh."** (pg 471)
  - these models are less systematic than linear modeling

### 19.1 Example: serial dilution assay
