## Chapter 20. Basis function models

- chapter 19 focused on nonlinear models with $\text{E}(y|X,\beta) = \mu(X_i,\phi)$ where $\mu$ is a parametric nonlinear function of unknowns $\phi$
- in this and following chapters, consider models where $\mu$ is also unknown

### 20.1 Splines and weighted sums of basis functions

- replace $X_i \beta$ with $\mu(X_i)$ where $\mu(\cdot)$ is some class of nonlinear functions
  - different options for modeling $\mu$ including with basis function expansions or Gaussian processes (next chapter)
- basis function approach: $\mu(x) = \sum_{h=1}^{H} \beta_h b_h(x)$
  - $b_h$: set of basis functions
  - $\beta_h$: vector of basis coefficients
- common choices for basis functions are:
  - **Gaussian radial basis functions**: multiple centers of the basis functions with a width parameter controlling a set of Gaussian functions
  - **B-spline**: a piecewise continuous function based on a set of knots
    - knots locations control the flexibility of the basis
    - knots cn be placed uniformly or non-uniformly (e.g. based on the density of the data)
    - can use a "free knot approach" with a prior on the number and location of knots, but is computationally demanding
    - instead can use priors on the coefficients $\beta$ to shrink values to near 0

## 20.2 Basis selection and shrinkage coefficients

- common to not know which basis functions are really needed
- can use a variable selection approach to allow the model to estimate the "importance" of each basis function
  - can then either select the best model from the posterior or average over all possible models by weighting each basis by its importance
- possible for some bias based on initial choice of the basis functions
  - implied prior information on the smoothness and shape of the model
  - can include multiple types of basis functions in the initial collection
